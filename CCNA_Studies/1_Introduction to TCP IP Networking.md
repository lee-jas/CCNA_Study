## Key Topics
- Explain the concept of IP routing
- Depicting data-link services for the purpose of delivering IP packets from host to host
- Identify the five steps to encapsulate data on the sending host
- Defining segment, packet, and frame
- Overview the TCP/IP model

## Notes
- The TCP/IP model both defines and references a large collection of protocols that allow computers to communicate.
- TCP/IP application layer protocols provide services to the application software running on a computer. The application layer does not define the application itself, but it defines services that applications need.
- TCP/IP transport layer includes a smaller number of protocols. The two most commonly used transport layer protocols are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
	- Segment
- Adjacent-layer interaction refers to two layers on the same computer communicating 
- Same-layer interaction refers to the same layer on two different computers communicating
- TCP/IP network layer includes the Internet Protocol (IP) and provides a service of forwarding IP packers from one device to another.
	- Packet
	- Router
- TCP/IP data-link layer provides services to the layer above it. Link-layer details are used to send a packet to the next host/router
	- Frame
- TCP/IP physical layer defines the cabling and energy that flow over the cables
	- Bit
- Encapsulation refers to the process of putting header around some data
	- de-encapsulation
