## Notes
- Wide-Area Network (WAN)
- WAN tech defines L1 standard and L2 protocols used to communicate over long distances
- WAN links between two routers to connect LANs
- The leased line service is a L1 service that delivers bits in both directions at a predetermined speed using full-duplex logic
	- telco
- Different names for a leased line include leased circuit, serial link, point-to-point link, T1, WAN link, and private line
	- Serial link refers to the fact that the bits flow serially and that routers are serial interfaces
- Leased line provides a L1 service
	- To make use of it, routers on the ends of the line use one of two L2 protocols: High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) or Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
- Forwarding IP packets
	- A leased line with DHLC creates a WAN link between two routers so that they can forward packets for devices on the attached LANs
- Ethernet WAN service/Ethernet WAN/Ethernet Line Service (E-Line)
	- logically, behaves like a point to point connection between two routers
	- physically, behaves as if a physical fiber Ethernet link existed between the two routers
- Routing protocols give routers a means by which to learn routers to all the IP subnets in an internetwork 
- The default router/default gateway is sent a packet and knows where to route the data
- Each router keeps an IP routing table which lists IP address groupings called IP networks and IP subnets
- Two foundational rules of subnetting
	- Two IP addresses not separated from each other by a router must be in the same group (subnet)
	- Two IP addresses separated from each other by at least one router must be in different groups (subnets)
- Hostnames are used to identify other computers
- DNS allows a computer to find the IP address used by a hostname 
- Routers use ARP to know what MAC address to use for the destination 
- Ping uses ICMP to send a message called an ICMP echo request to another IP address
